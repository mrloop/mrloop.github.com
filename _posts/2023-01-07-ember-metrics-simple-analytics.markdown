This is a short post announcing [ember-metrics-simple-analytics](https://github.com/mrloop/ember-metrics-simple-analytics), an [ember-metrics](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-metrics) adapter for [Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com/). [Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com/) is a privacy-orientated analytics provider that I’ve been using since they started for all my websites and apps.

[ember-metrics](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-metrics) adds a small straightforward to use metrics service to your [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) app and allows you to integrate with multiple analytics providers without having to learn and implement a new API for each different analytics provider you want to use. [ember-metrics-simple-analytics](https://github.com/mrloop/ember-metrics-simple-analytics) is an adapter for [ember-metrics](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-metrics) that lets you easily integrate [Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com/) with your [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) app.

Before using [Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com/) I used Google Analytics, it was free, I already had Google accounts and had experience using Google Analytics. By removing it from this blog I reduced the amount of data Google can collect about people visiting this site and others I run. Google collects vast amounts of data across websites and devices. By using an alternative analytics provider I’m helping protect the privacy of my users. [Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com/) is GDPR compliant and also doesn’t use cookies so no cookie banners!

If your looking for a privacy-first analytics provider please give [Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com/) a try and if you're integrating it with an Ember.js app then you can do so simply with [ember-metrics-simple-analytics](https://github.com/mrloop/ember-metrics-simple-analytics).
